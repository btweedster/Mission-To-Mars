### *Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?*
On average on Mars the lowest atmospheric pressure month is Month 6 (745.1 Pa) and the highest atmospheric pressure month is Month 9 (913.3 Pa).

### *About how many Terran days exist in a Martian year?*
Estimating from the last graph, there is a peak around 750 days, and another around 1,375 days. So (1375 - 750) = 625. There are approximately 625 Terran days to one Martian year.
